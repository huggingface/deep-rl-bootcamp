# Unit 7: Robotics Simulations with PyBullet 🤖

One of the major industries that use Reinforcement Learning is robotics. Unfortunately, **having access to robot equipment is very expensive**. Fortunately, some simulations exist to train Robots:
1. PyBullet
2. MuJoco
3. Unity Simulations

We're going to use PyBullet today. And train two agents to walk:
- A bipedal walker 🦿
- A spider 🕸️

🏆 You'll then be able to **compare your agent’s results with other classmates thanks to a leaderboard** 🔥 👉 https://huggingface.co/spaces/chrisjay/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Leaderboard

We'll learn to use PyBullet environments and why we normalize input features.

Let's get started 🥳

## Required time ⏱️
The required time for this unit is, approximately:
- 1 hour for the hands-on.

## Start this Unit 🚀

## How to make the most of this course

To make the most of the course, my advice is to:

- **Participate in Discord** and join a study group.
- **Read multiple times** the theory part and takes some notes
- Don’t just do the colab. When you learn something, try to change the environment, change the parameters and read the libraries' documentation. Have fun 🥳
- Struggling is **a good thing in learning**. It means that you start to build new skills. Deep RL is a complex topic and it takes time to understand. Try different approaches, use our additional readings, and exchange with classmates on discord.

## This is a course built with you 👷🏿‍♀️
