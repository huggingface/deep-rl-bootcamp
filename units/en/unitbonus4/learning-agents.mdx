# An Introduction to Unreal Learning Agents

[Learning Agents](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/8OWY/unreal-engine-learning-agents-introduction) is an Unreal Engine (UE) plugin that allows you **to train AI characters using machine learning (ML) in Unreal**.

It's an exciting new plugin where you can create unique environments using Unreal Engine and train your agents.

Let's see how you can **get started and train a car to drive in an Unreal Engine Environment**.
