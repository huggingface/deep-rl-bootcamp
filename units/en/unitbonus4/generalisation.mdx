# Generalization in Reinforcement Learning

Generalization plays a pivotal role in the realm of Reinforcement Learning. While **RL algorithms demonstrate good performance in controlled environments**, the real world presents a **unique challenge due to its non-stationary and open-ended nature**.

As a result, the development of RL algorithms that stay robust in the face of environmental variations, coupled with the capability to transfer and adapt to uncharted yet analogous tasks and settings, becomes fundamental for real world application of RL.
