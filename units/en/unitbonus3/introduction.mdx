# DIAMBRA Arena Overview

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diambra/arena/main/img/github.jpg" alt="diambraArena"/>

DIAMBRA Arena is a software package featuring a collection of high-quality environments for Reinforcement Learning research and experimentation. It provides a standard interface to popular arcade emulated video games, offering a Python API fully compliant with OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium format, that makes its adoption smooth and straightforward.

It supports all major Operating Systems (Linux, Windows and MacOS) and can be easily installed via Python PIP. By following the [installation instructions here](https://docs.diambra.ai/#installation) listed in the official documentation, you will obtain both the `diambra` command line interface (CLI) and `diambra-arena` package, which provides our environments.

## Main Features

All environments are episodic Reinforcement Learning tasks, with discrete actions (gamepad buttons) and observations composed by screen pixels plus additional numerical data (RAM states like characters health bars or characters stage side).

They all support both single player (1P) as well as two players (2P) mode, making them the perfect resource to explore Standard RL (both online and offline) together with a wide number of Reinforcement Learning subfields, like Competitive Multi-Agent, Competitive Human-Agent, Self-Play, Imitation Learning and Human-in-the-Loop.

Interfaced games have been selected among the most popular fighting retro-games. While sharing the same fundamental mechanics, they provide different challenges, with specific features such as different type and number of characters, how to perform combos, health bars recharging, etc. Whenever possible, games are released with all hidden/bonus characters unlocked.

In this unit we will focus on Street Fighter III, but other historic games are also available, and the list will continue to grow. Switching between them is very straightforward, so at the end of the unit you will be able to easily target additional titles.

## Preliminary Steps: Download Game ROM(s) and Check Validity

After completing the installation, you will need to obtain the Game ROM(s) of your interest and check their validity according to the following steps.

First, it is possible to check available games with the dedicated CLI command:

```shell
diambra arena list-roms
```

which will produce an output similar to the following:

```shell
[...]
 Title: Street Fighter III - game_id: sfiii3n
   Difficulty levels: Min 1 - Max 8
   SHA256 sum: 7239b5eb005488db22ace477501c574e9420c0ab70aeeb0795dfeb474284d416
   Original ROM name: sfiii3n.zip
   Search keywords: ['STREET FIGHTER III 3RD STRIKE: FIGHT FOR THE FUTUR [JAPAN] (CLONE)', 'street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike-fight-for-the-futur-japan-clone', '106255', 'wowroms']
[...]
```

Then, you can search ROMs on the web using *Search Keywords* provided by the game list command reported above. Follow game-specific notes reported there, and store all ROMs in the same folder, whose absolute path will be referred in the following as `/absolute/path/to/roms/folder/`.

Finally, you should check ROM(s) validity running:

```shell
diambra arena check-roms /absolute/path/to/roms/folder/romFileName.zip
```

The output for a valid ROM file would look like the following:

```shell
Correct ROM file for Street Fighter III, sha256 = 7239b5eb005488db22ace477501c574e9420c0ab70aeeb0795dfeb474284d416
```

After completing these steps, you can proceed and execute the first test agent in the environments as explained in the next stection.
