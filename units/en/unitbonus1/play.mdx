1. In step 1, choose your model repository which is the model id (in my case ThomasSimonini/ppo-Huggy).

üëâ If you have any racing wheels/flight sim components connected to your computer be sure to disconnect them or you may have trouble selecting your model from the dropdown.

2. In step 2, **choose which model you want to replay**:
  - I have multiple ones, since we saved a model every 500000 timesteps.
  - But if I want the most recent one I choose Huggy.onnx

üëâ It's good to **try with different model checkpoints to see the improvement of the agent.**
